# BILF - Bug I would Like to Fix

"Bug I would Like to Fix" (BILF) is an event that challenges participants to identify and fix bugs in provided code. This GitHub repository contains a collection of problems that were prepared for the BILF event. Each problem is presented in the form of a problem statement and a solution code that contains a bug. The challenge for participants is to identify the bug in the solution code and provide a test case that will cause the solution code to fail.


## What is BILF?

BILF is an event that was created to challenge software developers and programmers to test their skills in identifying and fixing bugs in code. The event is designed to be a fun and engaging way for participants to improve their coding skills and learn new techniques for debugging software. Participants are provided with a set of problems that contain bugs, and they are challenged to find and fix these bugs within a given time limit.
## How to Participate

Participating is easy and fun! To participate, simply fork this repository and clone it to your local machine. Once you have the repository on your local machine, you can navigate to the folder for the problem you want to work on. Each problem is presented in a file called **<problem_name>.pdf**, which contains the problem statement, and files called **<problem_name>.py** and **<problem_name>.cpp**, which contains the provided solution codes.

To participate, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Read the problem statement carefully and study the provided solution code.
2. Try to identify the bug in the solution code.
3. Create a test case that will cause the solution code to fail.
4. Run both the provided correct code and the buggy code on your generated test case.

You can verify whether your test case is valid or not by checking the two generated outputs. 
## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the BILF project! If you would like to contribute a new problem to the repository, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder for your problem.
2. Write a problem statement in a file called **<problem_name>.pdf**.
3. Provide solution codes in files called **<problem_name>.py** and **<problem_name>.cpp**.
4. Provide the correct solution codes in files called **<problem_name> (Correct).py** and **<problem_name> (Correct).cpp**.
4. Add a file called **test_case.txt** that contains a test case that will cause the solution code to fail.
5. Submit your contribution as a pull request to this repository.
